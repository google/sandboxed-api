# These options determine whether CMake should download the libraries that
# Sandboxed API depends on at configure time.
# The CMake script SapiDeps.cmake checks for the presence of certain build
# targets to determine whether a library can be used. Disabling the options
# below enables embedding projects to selectively override/replace these
# dependencies. This is useful for cases where embedding projects already
# depend on some of these libraries (e.g. Abseil).
