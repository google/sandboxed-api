# The 'tool' example demonstrates:
# - a sandbox executor, sandboxee would be another program
# - sandboxee sandboxed before execve
# - very lax, separate sandbox policy written with BPFDSL
# - expose file descriptors to executor with ReceiveFd
# - set limits, wall time, filesystem checks, asynchronous run
# - test to ensure sandbox executor runs sandboxee without issue
