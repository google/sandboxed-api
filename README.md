## What is Sandboxed API?

The Sandboxed API project (**SAPI**) aims to make sandboxing of C/C++ libraries
less burdensome: after initial setup of security policies and generation of
library interfaces, an almost-identical stub API is generated, transparently
forwarding calls using a custom RPC layer to the real library running inside a
sandboxed environment.

Additionally, each SAPI library utilizes a tightly defined security policy, in
contrast to the typical sandboxed project, where security policies must cover the total
syscall/resource footprint of all utilized libraries.
